    "While they were out, Sarah said, “I tried cleaning the rug myself, but there was this snail on it that always seemed to leave a trail of slime behind it. I spent a few hours cleaning it, and the next day the slime trail was back.”\n",
    "\n",
    "When the investigator returned, they said, “Apparently, this cleaner had a special projects program, where they outsourced challenging cleaning projects to industrious contractors. As they’re right across the street from Noah’s, they usually talked about the project over **coffee and bagels** at Noah’s before handing off the item to be cleaned. The contractors would pick up the tab and expense it, along with their cleaning supplies.\n",
